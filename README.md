# rp2040_tft_controller_pcb
 RP2040-based controller board for the [MI0284QT-11 TFT LCD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1774) (ILI9341 controller chip) designed in KiCad.<br />
 Future plans are to modify this board to have an FPGA controlling the actual LCD, acting as a GPU, allowing the RP2040 (or another microcontroller) to run more complex programs.
